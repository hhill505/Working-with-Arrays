<h1>State List</h1>

<p>here is a list of states...</p>

<!-- iterate through each state in the array and put them into list items individually -->

<ul>
<!-- this works,  but for readability, leave a space after open brackets and closing -->
<% @states.each do |state| %>
<li><%= state %> </li>
<%end%>
</ul>
